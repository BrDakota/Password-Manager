# Password Manager
This is a console application that will generate and store passwords securely. This application handles storage locally on a database on my laptop.

The procees is simple. The program prompts me for a master password on startup and before adding or accessing any passwords. Upon adding or accessing a service it also prompts me to enter an email. The email is not saved anywhere and is used for added security to all of my passwords.

Passwords were all secured using different encryption algorithms and hashing algorithms such as AES and PBKDF2.
